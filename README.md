Synopsis

This is a social networking application for international students. It allows for user registration, group membership and creation, posts with tags, and creating and viewing event listings.

Motivation

We created this project as part of Lighthouse Labs' web development bootcamp. As a group we have personal experience as international students and understood that there were no good community building tools for international students that weren't tightly coupled with their institution. This project hopes to fill that gap. 

Stack

This project was writing in Ruby with the Sinatra framework.
